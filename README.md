imagewood CMS
=============

Imagewood is a CMS for managing web images on your VPS.
You can think about it as a self-hosted image hosting.

It is written entirely in Scala and Playframework2 and intended for use with Java/JVM infrastructure on a cloud service like OpenShift, or any other sane client like PHP Symfony.

We have no relation to the Imagewood company, 419 Main St. Oneonta, NY 13820. We just share the concise name for our product.
